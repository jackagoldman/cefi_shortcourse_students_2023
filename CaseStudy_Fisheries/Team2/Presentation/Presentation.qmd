## Goals

- Previous forecasting methods are old and out of date

- **Goal**: develop new forecasting methods and evaluate performance


## Candidate models
- three models:
  - Basic Ricker
  - Ricker with Env. Covariate
  - Power Model
  - Naive
  - Naive Linear Model
- We compared the performance of the models using RMSE
-

## Model comparisons

- graph of model performance

## Proof of Concept Forecast 


## Recommendation
